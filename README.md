## Aim: 
To build a Rock-Paper-Scissors game Application
## Description/Working of code:
1. The code first defines an array called choicee, which contains three strings: "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".

2. The program then takes a string as input from the user, who should enter one of the choices: "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". This input is stored in a variable called user.

3. The code then generates a random choice from the choicee array using the random.choice() function and stores this value in a variable called computer.

4. The program then compares the user's choice with the computer's choice. If the choices are the same, it prints "Both have the same choice so it's a tie!". If the choices are different, it determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

5. Finally, the program prints the winner of the round, whether it's the user, the computer, or a tie.
